# **UFOs**

## *Overview of Project:*
    -Dana, a data journalist, wants to write about the UFO sightings. In order to help her with this task, we created an interactive HTML file that held Dana's UFO data.
### Purpose:
    -The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript to build a table that could be filtered, and then store in an HTML file. This will allow users to filter the UFO sighting data provided to access what they need.
    
## *Results:*
    -Using the HTML that was created for this analysis is simple. Here are some instuctions on its use:
        -Once the user has opened the HMTL file the will see the header and an attached article (seen below).

        -In order to use the view the sighting data the user should scroll down. From there they will see all the sighting instances including the following information on them: date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments.
        -The user can find specific sighting instances by filtering the data with the provided filters to the left of the data table (see below).

        -The user can filter by the date, city, state, country, and shape. The user should simply type in the search box below their desired filter and their results can be seen on the right.
## *Summary:*
    -Overall, the project was successful in addressing what Dana had set out to do, however there are some changes that could be made to further improve the HTMLs usage.

### Drawbacks:
    -One drawback of this design is that you are unable to filter by all of the information provided. This may interfere with some of the analysis that people may be using the HTML for.
    
### Additional Recommendations:
    -One recommendation would be to exand on the sighting information that is provided, as this would allow for more eleborate analysis.
    -Another recommendation would be to include additional articles as this may provided more insight to users on UFO sightings.
